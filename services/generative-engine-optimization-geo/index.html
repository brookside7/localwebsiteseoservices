      <h2>What is GEO (in plain English)?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)</strong> is the practice of structuring your website and online presence so AI search systems
        can confidently understand who you are, what you do, where you operate, and why you're credible—then include you in AI-generated answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't replace SEO. It extends it. Classic SEO gets you crawled and ranked. GEO helps you get <em>quoted, summarized, and recommended</em>
        inside AI answers.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Why GEO matters for local businesses in 2026</h2>
      <p>
        Search is increasingly answer-first. Instead of ten blue links, users see AI summaries, "best options" lists, and conversational answers.
        That means fewer clicks—and more importance on being the source that gets referenced.
      </p>
      <p>
        For local visibility, Google states local results are based primarily on <strong>relevance</strong>, <strong>distance</strong>, and <strong>prominence</strong>.
        GEO strengthens relevance and prominence by making your business information and proof clearer across your site and profiles.
      </p>

      <h2>What we optimize for GEO (the practical checklist)</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>1) Entity clarity</h3>
          <p>Make it obvious who you are, what you offer, and where you serve (service areas, city pages, consistent NAP).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>2) Extractable answers</h3>
          <p>Front-load clear answers, add definitions, use short checklists, and write "question → answer → steps" sections.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>3) Structured data</h3>
          <p>Add LocalBusiness + Service + FAQ + Breadcrumb schema so machines can interpret pages correctly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>4) Proof and prominence</h3>
          <p>Case studies, reviews strategy, citations, and consistent business info—so you look real and trustworthy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>5) Internal linking</h3>
          <p>Connect services ↔ locations ↔ blog ↔ tools so relevance is reinforced and key pages are discoverable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>6) AI-feature readiness</h3>
          <p>Align with Google's AI inclusion guidance: prioritize visitors and unique value; keep pages clean and useful.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service pages</strong> that answer common questions in the first screen (pricing ranges, timeline, what's included).</li>
        <li><strong>Location pages</strong> that are unique and include real local proof (projects, neighborhoods served, photos, FAQs).</li>
        <li><strong>FAQ blocks</strong> that are actually visible (not hidden) and written in direct language.</li>
        <li><strong>Clear contact + trust signals</strong>: consistent NAP, licensing/insurance notes, policies, and real testimonials.</li>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Optional (advanced): llms.txt for AI navigation</h2>
      <p>
        Some site owners also publish an <code>/llms.txt</code> file to guide AI systems to the most important pages.
        It's a proposed standard (not required), but it's low-effort and can help tools focus on your best content.

      <h2>FAQs</h2>

      <h3>Is GEO different from SEO?</h3>
      <p>
        GEO extends SEO. SEO helps you rank in traditional results. GEO improves the odds that AI systems can confidently summarize and cite your site in AI answers.
        The foundation still remains "unique, satisfying content for users."
      </p>

      <h3>Will GEO help me rank in the Google map pack?</h3>
      <p>
        GEO supports map pack performance by improving relevance and prominence signals (clarity, trust, proof), but maps also depend on distance/proximity.
        Google describes local ranking as primarily based on relevance, distance, and prominence.
      </p>

      <h3>What should I fix first for GEO?</h3>
      <p>
        Start with clarity: clean service pages, location/service-area signals, consistent NAP, and a properly optimized Google Business Profile.
        Then add structured data and publish weekly content that answers real customer questions.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need to blog for GEO?</h3>
      <p>
        You don't "need" a blog, but weekly content is one of the easiest ways to build topical coverage, create extractable answers, and earn trust over time—especially for local businesses.
      </p>

      <h3>How do we measure GEO results?</h3>
      <p>
        We track improvements in branded and non-branded visibility, local rankings, engagement and leads, plus how often your pages appear as cited sources in AI-driven search experiences (where measurable).
