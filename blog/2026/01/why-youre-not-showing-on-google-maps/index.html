          If your business isn't showing on Google Maps, it's usually not "one big thing"—it's a short list of common setup and trust issues.
          Below is a practical checklist to diagnose the problem and fix the highest-impact items first.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Definition (fast answer)</h2>
        <p><strong>Google Maps visibility</strong> means your business appears in Google Maps results (and often the "map pack") for searches related to your services, location, and brand.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What's happening (the common cause)</h2>
        <p>Most businesses disappear from Maps due to incomplete Google Business Profile setup, category/service mismatches, duplicate listings, address/service-area issues, or weak trust signals (reviews, consistent business info, and a clear website).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The checklist to fix it</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Confirm your profile is verified:</strong> Log into your Google Business Profile and ensure verification is complete and there are no pending issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Check your primary category:</strong> Your primary category should match your main service. Wrong categories can suppress visibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Fix address/service-area settings:</strong> Storefronts should show an address; service-area businesses should set service areas correctly and not display a home address if you don't serve customers there.</li>
          <li><strong>Eliminate duplicates:</strong> Search your business name + phone. If you find duplicates, merge/remove them.</li>
          <li><strong>Strengthen trust signals:</strong> Add real photos, ensure NAP consistency, and set up a consistent review request process.</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What to do first (priority order)</h2>
        <p>If you only have 30–60 minutes, do these in this order:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Priority 1:</strong> Verify profile status and resolve any warnings.</li>
          <li><strong>Priority 2:</strong> Correct primary category + service setup.</li>
          <li><strong>Priority 3:</strong> Fix duplicates and service-area/address configuration.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How this impacts Google Local and AI results in 2026</h2>
        <p>Clear, consistent business information and structured pages make it easier for search systems (including AI-powered results) to understand your services, your location, and when to recommend your business.</p>
        <p>For Maps specifically, correct profile configuration, strong relevance, and real-world prominence signals (reviews, consistency, proof) make the biggest difference over time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>FAQs</h2>

        <h3>How long does it take to show up on Google Maps?</h3>
        <p>It varies. Some fixes help within days, but competitive categories can take weeks as trust signals and activity build.</p>

        <h3>Do I need a physical address to rank?</h3>
        <p>No. Service-area businesses can rank without showing an address, but the profile must be configured correctly.</p>

        <h3>Will more reviews automatically improve rankings?</h3>
        <p>Reviews help, but they work best alongside correct categories, consistent business info, and a strong website.</p>

        <h3>What if my listing is suspended?</h3>
        <p>Stop making changes, review the suspension reason, and follow a clean reinstatement process with accurate documentation.</p>

        <h3>What should I fix first if I'm not showing?</h3>
        <p>Start with verification status, category accuracy, and address/service-area settings—then handle duplicates and trust signals.</p>
